## generator-basic-cpp [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A basic C++ app generator.

## Additional requirements

This generator relies on [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) to generate makefiles.  Once Cmake is installed, make sure it is in our path and is referenceable from the command line.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-basic-cpp using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).


```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-basic-cpp
```

## Help
```bash
yo basic-cpp --help
```
## Usage

Generating a new C++ application.  Specifying an application name is required, if you forget, you will be prompted for it.

```bash
yo basic-cpp [appname]
```

Adding a new class to your application.  New classes have their own header and implmentation files.  Each time you add a new class [Cmake](https://cmake.org) will be used to regenerate the makefile.

```bash
yo basic-cpp:class [classname]
```
